## Create a Fork & Pull Request

This method is suitable for **developer**. If you want to add a feature or patch the bug yourself, just follow this 5 steps :

1. To avoid duplicates, check existing issues, pull requests and commits (both master and develop branch) first
2. Fork CitCuit repo (**master** branch) to your GitHub account
3. Clone it to your computer locally
4. Make changes, commit and push it to your GitHub
5. Create a pull request back to CitCuit repo (**develop** branch)
